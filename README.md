# HomeCtrl 433mhz

This is an Arduino library to operate Energenie MiHome devices using an RFM69 transceiver. It operates in the 433mhz band using FSK and OOK modulation.

## Getting started

See example directory for sample code.

## Compatibility

This is developed, tested and used by the author with ESP32 controllers.
It *should* work with Arduino AVR boards, at some point I'll test it to confirm that.
