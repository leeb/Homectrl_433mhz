# HomeCtrl 433mhz

This is an Arduino library to operate Energenie MiHome devices using an RFM69 transmitter/receiver in the 433mhz band.

## Compatibility

This is developed, tested and used by the author with an ESP32 controller.
It *should* work with Arduino AVR boards, at some point I'll test it to confirm that.
